'''Replacement for the standard python module imaplib.

However this is not a drop in replacement and there's no easy path to migrate
programs based on 'imaplib' to this library.

The package contents are:

* imapll - low level imap library, it makes no attempt to parse the server
responses;
* imapp - parsed imap library;
* parsefetch - parses the fetch command responses;
* parselist - parses the list and lsub commands responses;
* sexp - scans nested parentheses lists on a string and transforms it in python
lists;
* infolog - example infolog class;
* utils - severall utility functions and classes;
